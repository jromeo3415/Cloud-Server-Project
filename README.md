This Socket-Based Networked File Sharing Cloud Server Project aims to create a client and server application that will transfer audio, video, and text files to and from a cloud-hosted server. 

**_IMPORTANT_** 
Users must change the "host" and "port" variables in tcp_file_client.py to the cloud-hosted virtual machine's ip address and the host you wish to use. The same must be done with "port" in tcp_file_server.py
