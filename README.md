This Socket-Based Networked File Sharing Cloud Server Project aims to create a client and server application that will transfer audio, video, and text files to and from a cloud-hosted server. 

**_IMPORTANT_**  
Ensure files uploaded from client side are in the same directory as the client's .py file. Use the "connect" command on client application before performing any file operations. Usernames and password can be changed in the list in the server program's .py file. 

**REQUIRED LIBRARIES**                
Install the following Python packages:
```bash
pip install rsa
pip install easygui
pip install socket
